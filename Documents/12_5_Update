Participants: Rahul, Praneeth, Alaa, and Chidambara

we met again for our regularly scheduled Zoom call.
We discussed our mid-project checkup with TA Mrinmoy

We planned out our next steps in terms of implementing our graph,
getting the Makefile working, algorithms, and traversal.

We'll continue working throughout the weekend and aim to complete 
the project by Wednesday and check in with Mrinmoy for additional
feedback.

We assigned roles and tasks and will check in regularly with each
other on Discord and set up additional Zoom calls to share screen/debug

We're on track to complete the project and have been maintaining our
timeline/goals.
