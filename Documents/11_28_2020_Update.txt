//This needs to be merged into Progress.pdf after

Today Chidambara, Praneeth, and I met briefly to discuss the project
on our weekly Zoom call at 6pm CST on Saturdays.

All members have committed multiple files to our repository since our previous meeting
where we got acquainted with Git commands and working together on files as well as loading
the dataset into our repository.

All members reviewed Graphs lecture context over Thanksgiving break and committed code.

We decided that before allocating certain algorithms to pairs of individuals
that we needed to discus how we will utilize the OpenFlights dataset to setup our graph.

We planned to create a basic MakeFile based off of the original lab so that we can quickly
test our code. We also have modified lab and MP code in the readFromFile.cpp

Out of the airports.txt file, we will be utilizing the latitude and longitude as our core 
data points.

We'll construct a vector that takes a pair of doubles to store latitude and longitude, and later 
will use the distance formula to generate a single double that will serve as the key.

Much of the work will be done when we construct the graph. We discussed an input for latitude and longitude
so that the user can setup the initial location which will be used to calculate distances from based on the 
vector pairs. Wraparound cases will be managed later.
